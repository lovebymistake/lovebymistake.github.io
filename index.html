            Love by Mistake was formed by Josh Christopher in 2014, originally as a record label imprint via Sony Music UK, that later went independent. With a passion for discovering, developing and advocating for emerging talent, the company naturally expanded into music promotion and digital PR. LBM has had some successful PR campaigns for both major label artists and rising unsigned projects including international global star Billie Eilish, 3× platinum artist Alice Merton, Germany's biggest artist of 2022–2023 Nina Chuba, EDM superstar Steve Aoki and One Direction's Louis Tomlinson.
